# Jack of Hearts Bar

This contains all the Udon Sharp scripts from this project. Feel free to use them for your own purposes. There is no documentation on how these scripts work, so use with disgression.

The Jack of Hearts is a recreation of a Dive Bar. The intention of the world is to be a small space to spend time in, perform musicial acts on its performance stage, and to have NPC systems.
